# A few notes to make X11 forwarding working

Today, I overcome a certain number of problems when trying to play my experiments from my home computer.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of problems I had to solve.

## Why setup X11 forwarding


## Setting up an X11 server


## .Xauthority does not exist

OK that's one is 

## Does it work?

The test I do is generally: `xlogo`. You should see a new red-and-white window with a X symbol.


## It is now OpenGL that makes our life miserable 

Similarly to the previous test, you can check whether OpenGL is working properly by launching `glxgears`.
