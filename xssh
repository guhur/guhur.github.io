# A few notes to make X11 forwarding working

Today, I overcome a certain number of problems when trying to play my experiments from my home computer.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of problems I had to solve.

## Why setup X11 forwarding


## Setting up an X11 server


## .Xauthority does not exist

OK that's one is 

## Does it work?

The test I do is generally: `xlogo`. You should see a new red-and-white window with a X symbol.


## It is now OpenGL that makes our life miserable 

Similarly to the previous test, you can check whether OpenGL is working properly by launching `glxgears`.
Here is the message error I obtained:

```
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  151 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
  Value in failed request:  0x0
  Serial number of failed request:  27
  Current serial number in output stream:  28
```

In my case, the VGA drivers are supported by my GPU card, an NVIDIA RTX 2070.
A first reasonable attempt seems to update these drivers from 418 to 430 using `apt`:

```
sudo apt install nvidia-drivers-430
```

You might also have some clashes between two types of drivers, see the forum post for [details](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=236486).
